Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I′m a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they′ve got none
Stay with me...
Let′s just breathe...
Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don′t wanna hurt, there′s so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me
You′re all I see...
